Parasite Tower is a tower defense game where you are a bio-weapon that self replicates and infiltrates a giant mecha. 
You must defend your infected mecha from enemy forces trying to take it back until full assimilation is complete.

The theme of the jam was the concept of you are a weapon. We interpreted this as a weapon that can be of any nature, kinetic weapons, explosive weapons, chemical weapons and even biological weapons. 
Our “character” is one such biological weapon that is used to infiltrate and assimilate key enemy targets.
